# Introduction to Pygame

Pygame is a graphics library for programming graphical applications in Python.  We are going to begin this introduction by drawing a single pixel on the screen.  To begin, we need to install the Pygame library.  In the terminal, type the following.

```
$ pip install pygame
```

You don't need to type the dollar sign.  It is just a marker for the command line.  The **pip **program should download Pygame to your computer.  If no error messages appear, Pygame should be installed.  To test this, enter the Python interpreter and import Pygame as follows.

## A First Program

 A computer screen is made up of an array of tiny dots called pixels.  We are going to  write a program to draw one pixel.
