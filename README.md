# Introduction

from [Computer Science Circles](https://cscircles.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/):

> A computer _program _ is a series of instructions, written in words, numbers and symbols. Just like any spoken sentence is in a human language like English or French, every computer program is in a _programming language_. A few popular programming languages areÂ **Python**, C++, JavaScript and PHP.

Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and is designed to prevent syntax from getting in your way. Its popularity both for beginners and experienced programmers continues to increase due to its relatively simple syntax and because it was designed to solve real-world problems.
