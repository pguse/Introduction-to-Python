# Working with Functions

The way in which functions work in Python is similar to the way a computer works.  Both the functions found in software and computer hardware can be described using an** INPUT-PROCESSING-OUTPUT** model.

A computer takes some sort of **data **\(numbers, strings, images, video\) as **INPUT**, performs some sort of **PROCESSING **on the data \(calculations involving numbers, modifying text in an email, editing pixels in an image\), and then produces some sort of **OUTPUT **\(text/graphics on the screen, a new file or email\).  A function in Python acts in much the same way, except that it _**may/may not**_ take **INPUT **and it _**may/may not**_ produce an **OUTPUT**.
