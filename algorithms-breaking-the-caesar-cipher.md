# Algorithms - Breaking the Caesar Cipher

The Caesar cipher can easily be broken. Two situations could occur that would determine the appropriate method :

1. an attacker **knows that a Caesar cipher is in use**, but does not know the shift value;
2. an attacker **knows \(or guesses\) that some sort of simple substitution cipher has been used**, but not specifically that it is a Caesar scheme;

### Method \#1:  Breaking a Known Caesar Cipher



### Method \#2:  Breaking any substitution cipher
